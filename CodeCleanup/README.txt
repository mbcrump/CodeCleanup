Throughout I added funny comments and 
Kept the default line when creating .NET Core Console


Line 1-3 - Shows Sort Usings and Remove unnessary usings
Line 10 - Add proper accessibility modifiers
Line 15 - Spacing not correct
Line 16 - replaces var with string for explicit types
Line 21 - Doesn't allow 1 liners for usings and cleans up System.IO
Line 22-24 - Cleans up spacing
Line 23 - removes unnecessary casts
